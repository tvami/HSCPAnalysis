# HSCP Analysis package

Code for reading external trees (like PixelTrees) and run 1D/2D template reco on the clusters.

Then take some low level quantities to look for Heavy Stable Charged Particles (HSCP). 



## Charge scale correction

pixelav/measuered charge = qscale

r_qMeas_qTrue() --> divide by this to get the real charge
